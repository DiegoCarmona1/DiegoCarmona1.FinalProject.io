        <h1>Basic Chicken Care</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Hatching/Hatchling</h2>
        <p>Either by incubator or natural chicken hatching, or perhaps simply through tractor supply or other hatcheries, You have found yourself with new baby chicks. Now your task is to care for them as best as you can in order to raise them from mere hatchlings to full grown adults ready to take on the world and provide you whichever resource your raising them for. Whether it be for meat, eggs or simply for companionship, providing care during these necessary and vital time is required to fully bring the best out of your chickens. To begin there are some objects and supplies that may be necessary for you to obtain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large plastic tubs in order to build a proper brooder for the chicks to stay in while their first weeks of life. A plastic tub is recommended instead of a regular cardboard box as they provide ease when it comes to cleaning the dirty, wet and messy conditions of the brooder.</li>
            <li>Basic heat lamp fpr temperature control.</li>
            <li>Food containers</li>
            <li>Water containers</li>
            <li>Fresh bedding/Newspaper clippings (Newspaper is recommended in the first week opr two as the chicks may attempt to eat the bedding shavings.)</li>
            <li>Chicken starter feed (starter feed is the necessary blend for small chicks from weeks 1 to 5)</li>
            <li>Chicken Grit (necessary for assisting with chicken digestion)</li>
            <li>Chicken Coop (won't be necessary until weeks 4-5)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you order baby chicks through any hatcheries than be warned that the chicks will be delivered through mail soon after hatching. Not all chicks may survive the process of being shipped to your home so be warned about allowing children near when the box is first opened (as ell as a warning for yourself). The surviving chicks should be then immediately brought to a water source and made to drink by dipping their beaks into the container of water. A recommendation is to place electrolytes and probiotics into the water to better acclimate the chicks and keep them healthy.</p>
        <p>Soon after hydrating the chicks, place in the brooder and test the heat lamp for the chicks preferred temperature concentration, by raising and lowering the lamp you can lower and raise the heat on the chicks. During their first week the lamp should be relatively close as to provide the best necessary heat. Keep the lamp on one side of the brooder as to best test what temperature the chicks need best. Their gathering at the point of heat between the cold and hot side will tell you what heat concentration is best for them as the colder chicks will be surrounding the heat more intensely, in which case lower the lamp further into the brooder.</p>
        <p>Brooder upkeep is vital as the dirtier the brooder becomes the greater chance of the overall chick health deteriorating. Changing water, cleaning bedding adn especially cleaning out wet bedding as this can cause an ammonia-like smell to permeate that can damage the baby chicks lungs. A recommended technique is to build two brooders to change out the chicks in. This will allow you to clean easier without little ones rummaging about whilst cleaning.</p>
        <p>A quick note on a condition that may be prevalent when shipping chicks to your home. Due to the stresses of being shipped, the chicks may develop a condition known as "Pasty Butt", where the chicks feces covers their rears and prevents them from defecating and urinating properly, in which case, simply wash their rears with warm water (the sooner the better) to clear their exit and allow them to continue, adding a little olive oil to their rear also prevents any other foreign matter from sticking for a short time. TRhis condition is only prevalent during their first few weeks so do not be alarmed if you come across it.</p>
        <p>Lastly, you've managed to set up your chicks with the best care you can manage, now the only obstacle is the basic care from week 1 to week 5, when their old enough and grown enough to enter the coop. A fair bit of advice for these growing weeks, the more contact with the chicks after the first week the better to keep the chickens friendly with you as much as possible, from petting them to sleep, feeding directly from hand, to playing with them. Another bit of advice is to always keep the chicks entertained, from small snacks and treats after week three to adding interesting objects like climbing rocks, perches, and more to keep the chicks entertained. Once the chicks have reached week five you have managed to brave the first hump of your new journey. From here on, it is about acclimating the chicks to their new coop, cleaning, feeding, and bonding with the chicks until they grow enough to begin laying eggs.</p>
        <h2>Adult</h2>
        <p>After 5 weeks of growing, you should have introduced your chicks to the coop. Beginning from this stage, slowly introducing Adult grower feed to further develop the chicks to their adult size and systems. Following that from that point on maintaining cleanliness with weekly cleanings and daily water changes and feedings. Soon after the chicks will have grown into premature adults, closing off the nesting box will be crucial to keep the chickens from sleeping within the box, after they have aged to 12-16 weeks of age they should be ready to access the nesting box and begin laying eggs. To promote egg laying, place false eggs or golfballs to fool the chickens into laying within the confines of the nesting box. Once the chickens have developed their waddles (red pieces of flesh present around the head and mouth regions) they will be ready to lay eggs, this could take from 16-20 weeks of age.</p>
        <p>Although not explained in the previous section, The requirement for the chicken coop is vital to provide a safe, comfortable, and clean living area for them. Some requirements for a quality coop include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
