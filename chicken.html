        <h2>Hatching/Hatchling</h2>
        <p>Either by incubator or natural chicken hatching, or perhaps simply through tractor supply or other hatcheries, You have found yourself with new baby chicks. Now your task is to care for them as best as you can in order to raise them from mere hatchlings to full grown adults ready to take on the world and provide you whichever resource your raising them for. Whether it be for meat, eggs or simply for companionship, providing care during these necessary and vital time is required to fully bring the best out of your chickens. To begin there are some objects and supplies that may be necessary for you to obtain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large plastic tubs in order to build a proper brooder for the chicks to stay in while their first weeks of life. A plastic tub is recommended instead of a regular cardboard box as they provide ease when it comes to cleaning the dirty, wet and messy conditions of the brooder.</li>
            <li>Basic heat lamp fpr temperature control.</li>
            <li>Food containers</li>
            <li>Water containers</li>
            <li>Fresh bedding/Newspaper clippings (Newspaper is recommended in the first week opr two as the chicks may attempt to eat the bedding shavings.)</li>
            <li>Chicken starter feed (starter feed is the necessary blend for small chicks from weeks 1 to 5)</li>
            <li>Chicken Grit (necessary for assisting with chicken digestion)</li>
            <li>Chicken Coop (won't be necessary until weeks 4-5)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you order baby chicks through any hatcheries than be warned that the chicks will be delivered through mail soon after hatching. Not all chicks may survive the process of being shipped to your home so be warned about allowing children near when the box is first opened (as ell as a warning for yourself). The surviving chicks should be then immediately brought to a water source and made to drink by dipping their beaks into the container of water. A recommendation is to place electrolytes and probiotics into the water to better acclimate the chicks and keep them healthy.</p>
        <p>Soon after hydrating the chicks, place in the brooder and test the heat lamp for the chicks preferred temperature concentration, by raising and lowering the lamp you can lower and raise the heat on the chicks. During their first week the lamp should be relatively close as to provide the best necessary heat. Keep the lamp on one side of the brooder as to best test what temperature the chicks need best. Their gathering at the point of heat between the cold and hot side will tell you what heat concentration is best for them as the colder chicks will be surrounding the heat more intensely, in which case lower the lamp further into the brooder.</p>
        <p>Brooder upkeep is vital as the dirtier the brooder becomes the greater chance of the overall chick health deteriorating. Changing water, cleaning bedding adn especially cleaning out wet bedding as this can cause an ammonia-like smell to permeate that can damage the baby chicks lungs. A recommended technique is to build two brooders to change out the chicks in. This will allow you to clean easier without little ones rummaging about whilst cleaning.</p>
        <p>A quick note on a condition that may be prevalent when shipping chicks to your home. Due to the stresses of being shipped, the chicks may develop a condition known as "Pasty Butt", where the chicks feces covers their rears and prevents them from defecating and urinating properly, in which case, simply wash their rears with warm water (the sooner the better) to clear their exit and allow them to continue, adding a little olive oil to their rear also prevents any other foreign matter from sticking for a short time. TRhis condition is only prevalent during their first few weeks so do not be alarmed if you come across it.</p>
        <p>Lastly, you've managed to set up your chicks with the best care you can manage, now the only obstacle is the basic care from week 1 to week 5, when their old enough and grown enough to enter the coop. A fair bit of advice for these growing weeks, the more contact with the chicks after the first week the better to keep the chickens friendly with you as much as possible, from petting them to sleep, feeding directly from hand, to playing with them. Another bit of advice is to always keep the chicks entertained, from small snacks and treats after week three to adding interesting objects like climbing rocks, perches, and more to keep the chicks entertained. Once the chicks have reached week five you have managed to brave the first hump of your new journey. From here on, it is about acclimating the chicks to their new coop, cleaning, feeding, and bonding with the chicks until they grow enough to begin laying eggs.</p>

    <section id="adult">
        <h2>Adult</h2>
        <p>After 5 weeks of growing, you should have introduced your chicks to the coop. Beginning from this stage, slowly introducing Adult grower feed to further develop the chicks to their adult size and systems. Following that from that point on maintaining cleanliness with weekly cleanings and daily water changes and feedings. Soon after the chicks will have grown into premature adults, closing off the nesting box will be crucial to keep the chickens from sleeping within the box, after they have aged to 12-16 weeks of age they should be ready to access the nesting box and begin laying eggs. To promote egg laying, place false eggs or golfballs to fool the chickens into laying within the confines of the nesting box. Once the chickens have developed their waddles (red pieces of flesh present around the head and mouth regions) they will be ready to lay eggs, this could take from 16-20 weeks of age.</p>
        <p>Although not explained in the previous section, The requirement for the chicken coop is vital to provide a safe, comfortable, and clean living area for them. Some requirements for a quality coop include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The coop must resistant to the elements, preventing moisture, excess heat and cold, and extreme winds.</li>
            <li>The size and space of the coop is dependent on the size of the flock. at minimum the coop should provide 2-3 square feet per bird. This necessary to prevent squabbling, overcrowding, and better maintain sanitary conditions.</li>
            <li>Ventilation must be available to maintain correct temperature and humidity within the coop, a stuffy and damp coop could spread mold, propagate illnesses and health conditions.</li>
            <li>The hens will require nesting boxes to lay when the time comes. A good rule of thumb is one box for every three hens, but the greater the number the more space the hens can have to more comfortably lay.</li>
            <li>Lastly, a decent run or pen on the outside of the coop as chickens prefer sleeping outside. Maintaining protection for these chickens is at the utmost importance however. As predators can easily come and massacre the flock if unguarded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A recommended technique in raising chickens is to allow them to free range. The movement and freedom given to the chickens help to manage stress, lessen weight, and allows them to feed on insects and natural grit (sand, gravel, pebbles). As the chickens feed on natural foraged items their eggs improve in quality and amount, as well lessening the chance of diseases or illnesses as they have greater roaming room rather than being trapped alongside each other. </p>
        <p>The feed of chickens is as important as the living conditions. This can determine their overall health, egg quality and well--being. As such many variants of feed have been made for different stages of the chickens life, and for their purpose. We have already mentioned two prominent feeds used for chickens, now we will introduce two more used for adults:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Layer feed: This feed is designed for adult hens who's purpose is the act of egg laying. Containing all essential nutrients and amino acids to produce quality eggs, as well as calcium (usually in the form of ground oyster shells) for stronger eggshells.</li>
            <li>Broiler feed: Created for the  purpose of growing the birds as large and full as possible for the use of their meat.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Along with basic fruits vegetables and grain to provide diversity and energy especially during the winter months, these all provide excellent feed for the flock. There are however foods that can be dangerous for chickens and so should be avoided at all cost. These foods include: Chocolate, avocados, onions, garlic, citrus fruits, and highly processed or salty foods. There are other potential food based threats so be sure to do further research if unsure.</p>
        <p>In order to continually maintain their health be sure to always provide quality feed, supplements if needed, provide space, treats and activities, always be hygienic for yourself and your chickens, give them free range, always check their health and well-being, behavior, and always have a vet with poultry experience and know-how to assist with any concerns that you may come across. Remember that chickens do best in flocks so be sure to provide friends and family for your chickens, even if it means burying yourself in a heap of responsibility and a giving yourself a gateway into the world of homesteading.</p>

    <section id="senior">
        <h2>Senior</h2>
        <p>Although rare for most families to keep a chicken past its prime. Many homestead families hold on to their hens once they have reached seniority for a couple of small reasons. The first being that the older hens are friendlier and provide more care and teaching for the younger hens and chicks. They also provide brooding for any negligent hens and continue to lay eggs well into their later years. Hens are usually considered seniors around the age of 5 and therefore have quite short lifespans, in kind the care needed to maintain these seniors is as much as the benefits their age provides.</p>
        <p>Senior hens commonly develop many health issues as they age, from arthritis, spurs in their legs, and general weakness, this leaves them especially vulnerable to predators that will seek out the aged chickens. Along with the movement issue3s, you wil also find that these hesn have more issues with foraging and eating. As such, breaking down their food into crumbles and clipping their toenails regularly will help to best maintain them. Above all, for older hens having an experienced veterinarian who is experienced with poultry will do wonders to best protect and manage your older hens.</p>
