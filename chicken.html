        <h2>Hatching/Hatchling</h2>
        <p>Either by incubator or natural chicken hatching, or perhaps simply through tractor supply or other hatcheries, You have found yourself with new baby chicks. Now your task is to care for them as best as you can in order to raise them from mere hatchlings to full grown adults ready to take on the world and provide you whichever resource your raising them for. Whether it be for meat, eggs or simply for companionship, providing care during these necessary and vital time is required to fully bring the best out of your chickens. To begin there are some objects and supplies that may be necessary for you to obtain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A large plastic tub in order to build a proper brooder for the chicks to stay in while their first weeks of life. A plastic tub is recommended instead of a regular cardboard box as they provide ease when it comes to cleaning the dirty, wet and messy conditions of the brooder.</li>
            <li>Basic heat lamp fpr temperature control.</li>
            <li>Food containers</li>
            <li>Water containers</li>
            <li>Fresh bedding/Newspaper clippings (Newspaper is recommended in the first week opr two as the chicks may attempt to eat the bedding shavings.)</li>
            <li>Chicken starter feed (starter feed is the necessary blend for small chicks from weeks 1 to 5)</li>
            <li>Chicken Grit (necessary for assisting with chicken digestion)</li>
            <li>Chicken Coop (won't be necessary until weeks 4-5)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you order baby chicks through any hatcheries than be warned that the chicks will be delivered through mail soon after hatching. Not all chicks may survive the process of being shipped to your home so be warned about allowing children near when the box is first opened (as ell as a warning for yourself). The surviving chicks should be then immediately brought to a water source and made to drink by dipping their beaks into the container of water. A recommendation is to place electrolytes and probiotics into the water to better acclimate the chicks and keep them healthy.</p>
        <p>Soon after hydrating the chicks, place in the brooder and test the heat lamp for the chicks preferred temperature concentration, by raising and lowering the lamp you can lower and raise the heat on the chicks. During their first week the lamp should be relatively close as to provide the best necessary heat. Keep the lamp on one side of the brooder as to best test what temperature the chicks need best. Their gathering at the point of heat between the cold and hot side will tell you what heat concentration is best for them as the colder chicks will be surrounding the heat more intensely, in which case lower the lamp further into the brooder.</p>
