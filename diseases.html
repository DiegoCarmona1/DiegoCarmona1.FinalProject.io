        <p>Throughout the time you spend raising your lovely animal pals, you will fid that they can be quite dirty if not taken care of properly. That very lack of care can cost you dearly if your not careful. One of the biggest killers throughout history was disease after all.  Some common farm animal based diseases include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bovine Tuberculosis: A type of TB caused by Mycobacterium Bovis bacteria. This disease spreads from contact with raw or undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk, or inhalation of the bacteria. Primarily present in bovine and other hoofed mammals, it can sp[read to human carriers. Symptoms include: weight loss, difficulty breathing, fatigue, intestinal discomfort, and some patients can have no symptoms for an extended period of time (This process known as latent TB infection).</li>
            <li>Campylobacteriosis: A common bacteria spread through the environment or the feces of farm animals. Due to its commonality it has a low death rate, but is especially dangerous to those with compromised immune systems, or the young and elderly. A common symptom being diarrhea</li>
            <li>Dermatophilosis: Also known as Lumpy wool, strawberry foot rot, rainscald, and rainrot. This disease is caused by contact with infected animals, such as deer, whom come into physical contact with anyone, animal or otherwise. The symptoms of this disease are matted hair, scabs, crusts, and areas of hair loss in animals. For humans it only usually causes sores and hands and arms, or location of contact with infected individual. Most infections aren't serious and disappear in time.</li>
            <li>Escherichia Coli (E. Coli): Most forms of E.coli Bacteria are harmless, the small percentage that make others sick though are far more dangerous. Contact through the feces of an infected animal or consumption of contaminated fod can cause the spread of this bacteria. It is most present during the earlier stages of farm animal lives such as baby pigs, lambs, and calves. Sopme symptoms of the most common strain, the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection, can cause severe stomach cramps, and bloody diarrhea. This type of infection can be fatal and is most dangerous for those of those under age 5 over age 65, or those with compromised immune symptoms.</li>
            <li>Salmonellosis: Salmonella is the sickness spread by contact with animals and animal feces. Contaminated foods and objects can spread the disease as well. Many different animals carry this bacteria but is most commonly linked to cases involving poultry. Usually most animals will not experience symptoms of salmonella, though there are exceptions in the case of diarrhea, and for pigs especially, a condition known as septicemia can cause the bloodstream to become infected. The symptoms for humans are fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms last 4-7 days from symptom appearance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see, there are plenty of potential diseases a human can contract along with your animals. Being wary and involved are the highest protection against these kinds of plagues and viruses. Some effective counters to these diseases include:</p>
