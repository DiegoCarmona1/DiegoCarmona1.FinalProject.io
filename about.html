        <h2>Beginnings</h2>
            <p>At the start we were only a small family home. I worked all day, my wife worked all night all to take care of our home. My daughter had begun to get sick more and more often. After a recommendation from a doctor to provide her with cleaner air and environment as opposed to shoveling pills and meds to handle the symptoms. We moved out into rural Oregon to help our child stay health and happy. We only had one real issue though, we had no clue how to go on from there. From spending several weeks on attempting to maintain my old job, seeking new ones from the surrounding areas, nothing truly worked out. We decided to focus on developing our land and farming and raising chickens for some small profit (a suggestion from my wife). The amount of time, patience, and effort it took to maintain all of the different plants, animals, and still have time to job search, i ended up piling all my energy into the homesteading half of my life. Slowly growing bigger and bigger, me and ny family managed to build a beautiful life here. The small 6 chicken flock is now close to 35, the barn that never existed now stands blocking my view of the sunrise and mountains.  I get more time with my family, more time to work on our well-being and health, and get time to work with my kids and teach them the things I always wanted to before my time came. My wife always mentions how much happier I seem, I hardly notice but maybe thats for the best. after a while going at this I (my wife) decided that we should share some of our finds and ideas with other like us, just as we had when we first began. I came up with the idea of adding the forum to this site (took a good amount of work to get it going). Now I see the community we helped start grow bit by bit and the knowledge we and other had to explore being shared endlessly, it makes us all feel proud and joyous.</p>

He has supported my decision to spread the homesteading knowledge, albeit not silently. But he has always had my back and could tell me how stupid I am when it comes to this computer stuff.</p>
